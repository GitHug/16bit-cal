16 bit calendar!
=========

This calendar was created by Kenny Pussinen, Robin Horneman, Robert Lööf and Fredrik Mäkilä as a group project for the course User Interface Programming 2 at Uppsala University. All classes has an author who was responsible for that class so it's easy to recognize who wrote what part of the code. I can only take credit for the classes I have written myself, however the whole project was certainly a group effort!

The program is created in Java with the user interface components created using Jawa Swing. The requirements for the course was to create a calendar which relies heavily upon drawable objects that we ourself created. In the main user interface, no buttons or other readily available components available in Java Swing were allowed to be used. 

This project uses JDom, an open source Java-based document object model for XML. It allows for easy to use storing and retrieval of data in XML. Credit goes to the people at www.jdom.org or here at https://github.com/hunterhacker/jdom/ .
